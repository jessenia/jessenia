<b>About Me</b> <br />
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jessenia, a Systems Engineer, Entreprenuer, Investor, Gardener, Trumpeteer, and Student Pilot
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in anything Cloud, Security, Systems and Systems Architecture related
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything about Blockchain, refining my skills in DevSecOps, and trying to master more spoken languages including Portuguese and Twi
- My 2022 Goals are to learn Python, Go, refresh my Leetcode skills, and add 3-5 more projects to my personal portfolio 
- Fun fact: I never took Git serious once I started my professional career 10 years ago as a developer. Instead, I focused on churning out projects and fixing defects for my employers aka getting real world skills. While that's great! I feel sad I can not take those things with me to show to the world! After much thought, I have decided to dedicate the remaining of 2021 and all of 2022 to making this a space to be proud of!
