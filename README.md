<b>A Summary of My Github Page</b> <br />
<p>I never took Github serious once I started my professional career 10 years ago as a developer. Instead, I focused on churning out projects and fixing things that broke in production for my employer. There are a lot of projects and accomplishments that will go unseen and only remembered by the folks that contributed to them. I want to make it clear that in my opinion there's no winner in having project experience through work projects versus personal projects. While I personally think in my experience, most employers put much more weight on work experience,  there are pros and cons for both. As a matter of fact, very few of the 100s of interviews I've had in my career have asked for or required my Github page. I personally felt bothered that I could not take the awesome things I worked on while employed with me to show to the world! I could only discuss them with those who asked. So there, in itself is a reason to spruce up your Github profile. Because of this, I have decided to dedicate the remaining of 2021 and all of 2022 to making this a space to be proud of! I personally have too much going on between my profession, family life, businesses, and other passions to sustain this habit on a daily basis. Previous personal projects became outdated from the lack of activity over the years. I've concluded that it's imperative that the things I work on be meaningful enough in order to have an interest in maintaining it long term. I'll end this long paragraph by expressing my entusiasm for a good start and I'll leave the rest in God's hands! <p/>
